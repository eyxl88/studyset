capitalism (economists),market society

capitalism in business / government,free enterprise system

capitalism (Heilbroner),historical formation of core institutions and distinctive movements different over places and time

most acknowledged achievement of capitalism,massive accumulation of wealth

differences from pre-capitalism,quantity,quality

Egypt's wealth,"surplus in production, more than needed for survival","spent excess on religious / public monuments, military works, and luxurious consumption"

use-value,wealth desirable only because of specific use case (war / worship / adornment)

capitalism's wealth,"produce commodities for sale, rather than direct use / enjoyment by owners"

commodities,"new form of wealth, rather than accumulation of use-value items"

exchange-value,"wealth under capitalism comes from its ability to be exchanged, rather than specific use case"

labor productivity (Smith),"only when production enlarges national ""capital""",intrinsic use-value of goods produced by labor is unimportant

capitalist pursuit of wealth (modern answer),utility maximization

capitalist pursuit of wealth (Smith),desire to better our condition is part of human nature

capitalist pursuit of wealth (cultural setting),pursuit of wealth replaces pursuit of military glory,capitalist pursuit of wealth (subconscious),"fulfills unconscious needs (prestige, domination, affect, frustration, animal spirits)"

Marxist circuit of wealth,M-C-M',money capital exchanged for commodities for a larger sum of money

primary identifier of capitalism,"M-C-M' is always in capitalism, but varies based on the commodity"

capitalist organization of surrounding activity,private property in the means of production,private property gives which right?

private property gives which right?,right of owners to withhold use of property from society,not the right to do whatever they want with property

power in imperial / feudal system,coercive force used to force labor to work

social power of capital,refusal of access to privately owned property,general populace unable to secure a living without access to capital's property

difference of capitalism in production,owners calim output as quid pro quo for access to property,"before, peasants claim surplus and just pay feudal lords a fixed fee",enslaved labor paid subsistence wages before that

employment as a feature of capitalism,contract between laborer and owner of capital,how access to property is attained,wokers sell a fixed number of working hours for a fixed wage payment,"employers sell products of contractual labor to pay wages and supplies, keeping extra money as profits"

profit,not specific to capitalism (trading gains precapitalism),"mercantile gains, capitalist gains, capital-labor relationship"

mercantile gains,inequality in economic position,wide disparities in knowledge or supply access,EXAMPLE: spice merchants discover foreign countries

capitalist gains,from disparities in resource productivity or productive capacity,"""quasi rents"" of Marshall and Schumpeter",have something that is more productive than others = temporary extra profits

capital-labor market relationship,surplus value created because labor's need is immediate and capital's need is long-term,employers can capture more value created by workers due to imbalance in need

differences between capitalism and feudalism,"in capitalism, gains go directly to owners of capital, not laborers, managers, or government officials","in feudalism, product flows from producers (peasants) who then renumerate feudal lords"

similarity between capitalism and feudalism,"both involve social domination where money flows to a superior class, not just rational exchange"

Completion of the Circuit of Wealth Accumulation,"political, not just economic challenge",replenish coffers of capitalist firms,reinforce vitality of M-C-M' principle

imperial / aristocratic to mercantile,fall of Roman empire: merchants with trading niches have local influence,9th and 10th century spent under feudal control,12th and 13th century see merchants with power and social status,merchants and guild masters organize production and trade between towns,merchants serve as finance for feudal aristocracy

mercantile to capitalist,17th century English revolution and 18th century French Revolution,"feudal social relationships, custom, and tradition decrease in importance",increase in purchase & sale organization of production and distribution rather than command and tradition, "propertyless, wageless labor force of dispossessed peasants, destroyed guilds, social change"

reasons for decreasing feudal lord power,16th century Spanish discovery of gold undermines feudal lords,runaway serfs move to towns and cities,national power and ruler-merchant alliances

political change under capitlism,split in traditionally seemless rulership,2 leadership branches

2 leadership branches,"law enforcement, war, legal violence, authority, ceremony","production or distribution of goods and services, social surplus extending beyond country borders, all material affairs"

capitalist characteristic of economy,state within a state extending beyond the borders of secular states

unique capitalist problem,how much should state interfere with economy?

economic and political freedom,private property is a sheild for personal rights,workers own their labor power,"workers can deny capitalists access to their labor, no longer enslaved",originally merchants protected wealth from seizures by kings using private property

Smith's natural liberty,economic sphere checks the state,increased human liberty seen in all advanced capitalist societies

#3 Capitalist Ideology,rationality taken to amass wealth not seen before,"means to an end, calculating, exchange-value, cost/benefit comparison"

previous cultural ideologies,"monolithic, religious, unified in all aspects of life"

capitalist ideology,"conflicting, diverse strands of science and secularism",wealth gathering supersedes concerns over good and evil,avarice now seen as interest and morality separated from economics

logic of capitalism,uncertainty of recapture and capitalism

internal dynamics of capitalism,individual capitalists always exposed to capture by others,disbursement of capital-as-money to public as wages / costs,each capitalist fights competitors to sell commodities and regain expended capital

uncertainty of recapture and inescapable disoolution,self defense through competitive advantages,expansion of capital through development of new markets

2 changes caused by competition,reduce costs by using machines rather than labor (one fixed capital to another),get public to purchase completely new forms of commdoities = rising living standards and material life

threats to capital by profit wage ratio,strengthening bargaining power of labor - can't cut wages or there will be no workforce left,"attempt to subsitute machinery for labor, cost-reducing effots"

3 ways to manage profit-wage ratio,comapnies attempt to substitute machinery for labor for cost efficiency,government enforced policies maintain a profitable balance between capital and labor,systematic failures / crises create unemployment

hallmark of market system,capacity to match supply and demand without help of government

comparative systems approach,command economies require rigid planning,capitalist economies are responsive to changing demands

moral change in capitalism,legitimization of acquisitive behavior

large scale tendencies,accumulates wealth on unprecedented scale (2),changes in institutions (2),interruptions / failures break accumulation momentum

unprecedented accumulation (scale),increase in GNP in developed countries,augments volume of output and M-C-M' process,knows no national boundaries

international capitalism,use neighboring countries as markets for exports or cheap labor,"the strong siphon the surplus from the weak, continuing ancient domination patterns"

changes in institutions,highly skewed size distribution of enterprises,growth of large public sectors

reasons for size inequality,economic disruptions affect the weak more than the large,"mergers, trustification, defensive business strategies",different growth rates of different units of capital

reasons for public sector growth,to mititgate instability of market,increasingly disruptive crises like the Great Depression caused by the rigid structure of capitalism require mitigation

failures that disrupt accumulation,crisis prepares for renewal of accumulation afterwards

ancient equivalent of economic crises,dynastic succession issues

periodization,early to late mercantilism,preindustrial,early to late industrial capitalism,modern (late / state) capitalism

characteristics determining periods,size and business type of firms,methods of engaging or supervising labor (cottage vs. mass production),labor unions,"tech progress (tools, machines, equipment)","organizational evolution (proprietorships, family corps, managerial bureaucracies"

"David Gordon ""Social Structure of accumulation""","changing tech, organizational, and ideological conditions",accumulation process exploits possibilities of each stage of capitalism,accumulation hits limitations,accumulation transcends limitations by institutional changes

intra period dynamics,national capitalisms transform from 1 stage to another at different speed,the same M-C-M' pressures don't push in a clearly defined direction,"even Marx and Smith only knew what would happen in their own capitalist stages, not beyond"

post WW2 capitalism boom,increasing political economic interconnection,bourgeoisification of working class life led to less c lass conflict,"mass consumptions, foreign trade, and production",Japanese capitalism,extraordinary tech development

early 1950s - mid 1970s,longest capitalism boom,1980s,fall in US and European growth rates

1980s,fall in US and European growth rates

reasons for fall in growth rates,sustained public expenditure became inflation,exhaustion of possibilities,international capitalism led to imports of foreign goods,tech saturation caused attention to come to ecological harm,bourgeoisification of labor reduced adaptive pressures

future of capitalism,unknown since it is not certain how institutions will change in response to these challenges

Smith's future,capitalims plateaus (complete attainment of riches),capitalism reaches a lengthy and deep decline

Ricardo and Mill's Future,a stationary state leads to associationist capitalism

Keynes future,socialization of investment

Marx's Future,series of worsening crises lead to temporary rejuvenation before a final reckoning with internal contradictions

Schumpeter's future,bureaucratic socialism

contemporaries' future,not concerned
