RBC,Real Business Cycle,%deltaA = %deltaY - %deltaX,% change in growth-accounting number = % change in outputs - % change in inputs

EMH,Efficient Market Hypothesis,the market knows best and determines the correct prices based on supply and demand,the market knows all information necessary to get the right prices

GFC,Global Financial Crisis (2007-2010)

Phillips Curve,inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment,government spending can reduce unemployment,relationship attacked due to inflation and unemployment BOTH increasing during OPEC oil crises

rational expectations,agents do not make repeated errors,people are not necessarily rational,people understand the system and have all available information to make decisions

Keynesian consensus,private investment (the catalyst of growth in a capitalist system) is inherently unstable,government intervention / socialization of investment is the way to address this

achilles heel of capitalism,economy can contract indefinitely

ZLB,Zero Lower Bound,interest rates cannot really go below zero

QE,Quantitative Easing,policy tool used by banks to increase monetary supply during economic downturns

RA,Representative Agent,maximizes consumption u(c) s.t. budget constraints

REH,Rational Expectations Hypothesis

RF,Representative Firm,maximizes profit (R - C) s.t. tech constraints

Non-ergodicity,History is no guide to the future,The average outcome for a group of organisms is not a reliable estimate of the average outcome for an individual organism over time,Today may be very different from yesterday,Anecdote: Russian Roulette; probability vs. individual outcome,ECON: individual may have very different outcome from average (eg income)

Computational irreducibility,calculations cannot be simplified,system cannot be reduced to simpler form,no shortcuts in understanding or computation,Anecdote: Enigma,ECON: interconnected / complex system cannot be understood as a set of equations

Emergence / emergent phenomena,Collective behavior of a large number of microscopic constituents is qualitatively different from behavior of each individual constituent,Anecdote: seatbelts and hockey helmets,ECON: changes to financial market regulation / tax law do not always produce the expected result,cannot make predictions about a system based on one part of the system

Radical uncertainty,"The future (eg 30 years from now) cannot be predicted due to emergence, computational irreducibility, and non-ergodicity"
