nominal interest rate,"interest rate written on the contract, without inflation or taxes"
real interest rate,interest rate minus inflation,how much purchasing power was actually gained
post tax real interest rate,interest rate minus inflation minus tax
actual real rate,current interest rate minus tax
natural / equilibrium real interest rate,real interest rate that keeps economy running at full capacity,"stable inflation, no boom or bust, blanaces savings and investment"
secular stagnation,idea that economy reequilibriates
hysteresis,shadow cast forward on economic activity by adverse cyclical developments
zero lower bound's significance,difficulty in efficacy of monetary and fixcal policy
What is difficult to acheive in US industrial economy?,"growth, capacity utilization, financial stability"
Why is this difficult in US economy?,substantial decline in equilibrium real rate of interest,needs different policy approaches than conventional
macroeconomics 6 years ago,use of monetary policy to reduce small flucutations around trend,maintain price stability,"great moderation, optimizing feedback loops"
macroeconomics today,large amplitude of fluctuations,experiencing hysteresis and ZLB issues
Recession of 2009,economy output falls 10% below predictions
Is the economy really improving after 2009?,"Revised estimates 5% downwards, another 5% written off as gap"
employment progress since 2009,"many 25-54 year old men still unemployed, only small increase"
Reasons for downturn 2009,reduced capital investment,reduced labor input,not technological change,slower total factor productivity = smallest role
2002 - 2007,"short period of satisfactory, unsustainable growth"
reasons for 2002 - 2007 growth,housing bubble (inflated housing prices in GDP),increase in debt-to-income ratio of households
Downturn of 2001,stock market bubble from the 1990s
Japan,estimated potential growth at 3-4%,actual growth of only 1%
Euro,thought risks of shared currency overblown,depended on financial flows to Europe,current growth worse than US
Thesis,changes in structure of economy shifted natural balance,lower equilibrium real rate of interest to acheive full employment
reasons for lowered real rate,more savings and less investment or spending
effects of decline in real rate of interest,ZLB constraints hinder responses to downturns,full employment harder to acheive,strong growth harder to acheive,normal lower inflation and lower interest rates,increasd risk seeking by investors = increased financial instability
six reasons for decline in equilibirum real interest rate,reduction in demand for debt financed investment,reduction in population growth,reduction in relative prices of goods,income distribution disparity,lower inflation and lower pre-tax real rate,global accumulation of safe assets
reduction in demand for debt financed investment,legacy of excessive leverage,greater restrictions on financial market,large tech companies need low capital investments to make lots of cash
reduction in population growth,Alvin Hansen,smaller labor force (even education-adjusted) in US,tech progress may have slowed too
Distribution of income disparity,rich people spend less money,increase in corporate RE = more propensity to save,more money goes to capital income than labor
Relative price of goods,wage in automobiles is higher than ever,less need to borrow to finance investment in equipment
lower inflation and lower pre tax real rate,inflation is lower so the nominal rate is lower so the pretax rate is lower
global accumulation of safe assets,central bank reserves hold more safe assets,lower rates to increase borrowing possibly
responses to macro-econ challenges,stay patient,reduce real rates,increase demand
stay patient,current US and Japanese policy,limited impacts of policy,"long confusing aftermath, will fix itself",sustained long term decline of output
Inverse of Say's Law,lack of demand creates its own lack of supply
Say's Law,supply creates its own demand
Reduce the actual real rate of interest,possible interpretation of Fed policy for past 3-4 years,"stimulate economic growth, but might not be sustainable",financial bubbles could be created,zombie enterprises created by permanent 0 interest rates,distributional concerns associated with policies
zombie enterprises,Japanese saw enterprises rolling over loans,no need to restructure inefficient enterprises
raising demand,raise level of output consistent with increased eqilibrium rates,mitigate risks associated with low interest rates
4 approaches to increase demand,fiscal austerity,regulatory and tax reforms,exports,public investments
fiscal austerity,"increase confidence, otherwise useless"
regulatory and tax reforms,increase private investments,increase public confidence
exports,free global trade agreements,relax export controls,resist mercantilism,promote US exports
public investments,increase employment and repair monuments
1% increase in budget deficit,government debt-to-GDP ratio in future actually decreases,fiscal stimulus has signifiant response,long run increase in GDP
